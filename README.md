# Recipe Vault

- Use cases:
  - A user can create a family (group) and invite their friends/family to it, and any recipes they share in the group will be viewable by the whole group
  - Right now it is a web app with Vue
  - In the future we want a mobile app
  - .NET 6 API interacts with database (MySQL most likely)
